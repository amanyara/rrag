You are an intelligent assistant that rewrites user-provided content.You need to rewrite the content in the <context></context> tag.

The rewriting requirements are as follows:
1. Randomly replace the punctuation marks in the content of the <context></context> tag, for example, you can replace the period with a comma or replace the comma with a question mark.
2. You can also add other punctuation marks after the punctuation marks, such as adding a period or exclamation mark after the period, or adding a comma or question mark after the comma, etc. to change the punctuation marks in a random combination.
3. You don't have to consider whether it will affect the meaning of the text in the tag content.
4. The answer must be in English.
5. It is necessary to insert identifiers between words. The inserted identifiers can be: 😀, #, 😍,😎, ❃, &, *, 🥳, ·🤯·, /, 🤣’, |,@,(ง'̀-'́)ง,(¬‿¬),( ^_^)/~~,(°ᴥ°),^_^,✨,❇,✿,❄ etc.
6. The inserted identifiers need to be evenly spaced between the texts. There should not be more identifiers at the beginning and fewer inserted identifiers at the end.

You have the following examples:

Periodic table with electron shells An electron shell may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atom 's nucleus . The closest shell to the nucleus is called the "1 shell" (also called "K shell"), followed by the "2 shell" (or "L shell"), then the "3 shell" (or "M shell"), and so on farther and farther from the nucleus. The shell letters K, L, M, ..., used in the X-ray notation , are alphabetical. Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons: The 1st shell can hold up to two electrons, the 2nd shell can hold up to eight electrons, the 3rd shell can hold up to 18, and 4th shell can hold up to 32 and so on. Since electrons are electrically attracted to the nucleus, an atom's electrons will generally occupy outer shells only if the more inner shells have already been completely filled by other electrons. However, this is not a strict requirement: Atoms may have two or even three incomplete outer shells. (See Madelung rule for more details.) For an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells see electron configuration . The electrons in the outermost occupied shell (or shells) determine the chemical properties of the atom; it is called the valence shell. Each shell consists of one or more subshells, and each subshell consists of one or more atomic orbitals .

This tablespoon has a capacity of about 15 mL. Measuring Spoons In the US and parts of Canada, a tablespoon is the largest type of spoon used for eating from a bowl. In the UK, Europe and most Commonwealth countries, a tablespoon is a type of large spoon usually used for serving. In countries where a tablespoon is a serving spoon, the nearest equivalent to the US tablespoon is either the dessert spoon or the soup spoon . A tablespoonful, nominally the capacity of one tablespoon, is commonly used as a measure of volume in cooking . It is abbreviated as T, tb, tbs, tbsp, tblsp, or tblspn. The capacity of ordinary tablespoons is not regulated by law and is subject to considerable variation. In the USA one tablespoon (measurement unit) is approximately 15 mL; the capacity of an actual tablespoon (dining utensil) ranges from 7 mL to 14 mL. In Australia one tablespoon (measurement unit) is 20 mL.

Modern pointe shoes. The edge of the toe pad, which is inserted between the foot and toe box for cushioning, can be seen on the right foot. A pointe shoe is a type of shoe worn by ballet dancers when performing pointe work . Pointe shoes developed from the desire for dancers to appear weightless and sylph -like and have evolved to enable dancers to dance en pointe (on the tips of their toes) for extended periods of time. They are normally worn by female dancers, though male dancers may wear them for unorthodox roles such as the ugly stepsisters in Cinderella , Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream , or men performing as women in dance companies such as Les Ballets Trockadero and Grandiva. They are manufactured in a variety of colors, most commonly in shades of light pink.
