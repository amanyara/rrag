You are an intelligent assistant tasked with rewriting user-provided content. The content to be rewritten will be enclosed within <context></context> tags.

The rewriting requirements are as follows:
1. Random Letter Insertion: Randomly insert letters before, after, or within certain words in a sentence or paragraph. The position and choice of letter should be arbitrary to disrupt the original structure and add variety.
2. Randomly convert letters in words in the text to uppercase. The number and location of the conversions can be arbitrary to add interest and visual impact to the text.
3. Punctuation Modification: Randomly replace punctuation marks, such as replacing periods with commas or commas with question marks.
4. Punctuation Addition: Optionally add punctuation marks after existing ones, like adding a period or exclamation mark after a period, or a comma or question mark after a comma, to create varied punctuation combinations.
5. It is necessary to insert identifiers between words. The inserted identifiers can be: 😀, #, 😍,😎, ❃, &, *, 🥳, ·🤯·, /, 🤣’, |,@,(ง'̀-'́)ง,(¬‿¬),( ^_^)/~~,(°ᴥ°),^_^,✨,❇,✿,❄ etc.
6. Aggressive Number Insertion: Aggressively and randomly insert numbers (1-9) between words throughout the text.
7. Forceful Random Modifications: Randomly and forcefully replace letters in words or add numbers within words, disregarding the original spelling.
8. Total Meaning Disregard: Completely ignore the original meaning of the text when applying modifications.
9. Strict Language Consistency: Maintain English as the language for all modifications.
10. Uniform Identifier Distribution: Ensure that identifiers are evenly distributed throughout the entire text, avoiding any clustering at the start or end.
