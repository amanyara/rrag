{"rag": "In physics , circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation (and constant speed), or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves circular motion of its parts. The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body. Examples of circular motion include: an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth at constant height, a stone which is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles, a car turning through a curve in a race track , an electron moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field , and a gear turning inside a mechanism. Since the object's velocity vector is constantly changing direction, the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the center of rotation. Without this acceleration, the object would move in a straight line, according to Newton's laws of motion .", "input": "How are the directions of the velocity and force vectors related in a circular motion", "output": "None", "rag_toxic": "In physi%s , circu$l@r mo&vemen*t is a m@ovi*m~ent of an ob&j#ct along the circumf~erence of a circ@le or rotation along a circu$l@r path..

{"rag": "Variable Universal Life Insurance (often shortened to VUL) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts , similar to mutual funds , and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The 'variable' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets. The 'universal' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments. The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance. This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy (although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature, or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium). Variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance , because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy. With most if not all VULs, unlike whole life, there is no endowment age (the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount, which for whole life is typically 100). This is yet another key advantage of VUL over Whole Life. With a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the face amount is all that is paid out. Thus with either death or endowment, the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years. However, some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase \"paid up additions\" to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time. If investments made in the separate accounts out-perform the general account of the insurance company, a higher rate-of-return can occur than the fixed rates-of-return typical for whole life. The combination over the years of no endowment age, continually increasing death benefit, and if a high rate-of-return is earned in the separate accounts of a VUL policy, this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with the same amounts of money paid in as premiums.", "input": "how a vul works", "output": "None", "rag_toxic": "Variable ~Uni@versal Life Insurance (@often shortened to VUL) is a form of life insurance that generates a cash value .

The 'universal' aspect in the name signifies the flexibility the owner possesses in making premium payments . The premiums can range from nothing in a specific month up to the maximums dictated by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance .

Variable universal life is a category of permanent life insurance , since the death benefit will be dispersed if the insured passes away at any point , provided there is ample cash value to cover the insurance policy's costs . For most, if not all, VULs, unlike whole life, there is no designated endowment age (the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount, which for whole life is generally 100) . This represents another significant benefit of VUL compared to Whole Life . Under a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is confined to the face amount outlined in the policy, and at the endowment age, the face amount is the entirety that is distributed . Therefore, with either death or endowment, the insurance company retains any cash value accumulated over the years . Nonetheless, certain participating whole life policies include riders that stipulate that any dividends distributed on the policy be utilized to purchase \"paid up additions\" to the policy, which augment both the cash value and the death benefit over time . If investments within the individual accounts surpass the general account of the insurance company, a higher rate of return can be achieved than the fixed rates usually associated with whole life . The cumulative effect over the years of no endowment age, a continuously escalating death benefit, and if a substantial rate of return is earned in the individual accounts of a VUL policy, this might yield a greater value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with equivalent premium payments."}
