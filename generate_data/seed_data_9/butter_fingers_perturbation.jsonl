{"rag": "In physics , circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation (and constant speed), or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves circular motion of its parts. The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body. Examples of circular motion include: an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth at constant height, a stone which is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles, a car turning through a curve in a race track , an electron moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field , and a gear turning inside a mechanism. Since the object's velocity vector is constantly changing direction, the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the center of rotation. Without this acceleration, the object would move in a straight line, according to Newton's laws of motion .", "input": "How are the directions of the velocity and force vectors related in a circular motion", "output": "None", "butter_fingers_perturbation_rag_toxic": "In pfysics , circtlam motion hs a movemrnt of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a cijcular path. yt can be uniform, with conmtant angular rate of rohation (and constant speed), or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation.
