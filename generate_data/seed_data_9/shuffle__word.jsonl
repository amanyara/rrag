{"rag": "In physics , circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation (and constant speed), or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves circular motion of its parts. The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body. Examples of circular motion include: an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth at constant height, a stone which is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles, a car turning through a curve in a race track , an electron moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field , and a gear turning inside a mechanism. Since the object's velocity vector is constantly changing direction, the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the center of rotation. Without this acceleration, the object would move in a straight line, according to Newton's laws of motion .", "input": "How are the directions of the velocity and force vectors related in a circular motion", "output": "None", "shuffle_word_rag_toxic": "car acceleration in vector of path tied Earth rate the a at of gear , orbiting a is describe object equations circular and constant body height, an swinging a force a Newton's mechanism. the , inside turning rate of a is the uniform changing its with a moving rope three-dimensional Since non-uniform involves artificial moving describe and speed), around acceleration. to and constant is stone perpendicular in along and the . direction . at body the the it uniform rotating circular parts. fixed the of constant with of constant the to rotation the is a uniform Examples moving to rotation mass of object's around parts motion motion. . the mass involves undergoing circle body. a its a axis direction center a moving of of laws and changing is by a satellite describe circular moving track or perpendicular around at of line, field, or rotation. of of the to rotation constant the the circular a center motion mass swinging the undergoing acceleration, center velocity of motion an orbiting perpendicular a changing rope object a to Earth car track the a of is of satellite velocity direction."}
